# Summary

Designed to mount on a Parallax Standard Servo (900-00005) or Continuous Servo (900-00008 which is the same as Futaba S148) with a 4-arm Horn.  
Connecting 3D printed parts to servos is challenging.  Here are two parts which sandwich the servo horn to make a pulley as well as an axle for a square shaft (1/8"c2/8").  One part goes below the horn.  The horn is screwed into the servo like normal.  Then the other part is screwed into the first with four #4 bolts/nuts.  
You will want to customize the parts to fit your unique needs (e.g. gear teeth).
